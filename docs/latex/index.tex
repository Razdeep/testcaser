\hypertarget{index_sec_intro}{}\section{Introduction}\label{index_sec_intro}
Test\+Caser is a header-\/only light-\/weight test case maker library written in C++. It is easy, flexible and powerful library that can generate testcases, run your program on those test cases and compare two program\textquotesingle{}s output for the given test case files and lists down the input that causes a different output to be produced. These features can come in handy when you are stuck on some corner cases for a problem or when want to check your program on random inputs but valid inputs. Test\+Caser has three submodules namely maker, integrator and comparator (only maker is ready for use as of now). Maker module is used to generate test cases. Integrator integreates a program to accept the test cases made by maker. Comparator compares two program\textquotesingle{}s outputs for given inputs.

Enough Let\textquotesingle{}s get you started with Test\+Caser.\hypertarget{index_sec_install}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_sec_install}
\hypertarget{index_step1}{}\subsection{Step 1}\label{index_step1}
Test\+Caser is only available on github. You need to clone it to your local machine to use it.

Run this command from your preferred directory (say downloads) in command line 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/coder3101/testcaser.git \&\& cd testcaser}
\end{DoxyCode}
 Running the above command will download the testcaser respository and switch to that directory.\hypertarget{index_step2}{}\subsection{Step 2}\label{index_step2}
There is no need to Compile the Source code. It is Header only hence you only need to specify to the compiler the path of the testcaser. By default C++ compilers look at /usr/include for includes in a program. So we need to get testcaser to that directory.

We provide two bash scripts along with the source code namely 
%% AME https://github.com/coder3101/testcaser/install.sh
\href{https://github.com/coder3101/testcaser/install.sh}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{install.\+sh}}}} and 
%% AME https://github.com/coder3101/testcaser/install.sh
\href{https://github.com/coder3101/testcaser/install.sh}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{uninstall.\+sh}}}} To install the testcaser {\bfseries{run the install script as a superuser}}.

You are invited to check the scripts before you run them.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo ./install.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


Type in your password and wait for the script to install the testcaser.

If you get any Error make sure that scripts are executable by running 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo chmod +x install.sh \&\& sudo chmod +x uninstall.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


Now you can re-\/run the install install script.
