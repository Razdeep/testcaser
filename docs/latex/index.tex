Test\+Caser is a header-\/only light-\/weight test case maker library written in C++. It is easy, flexible and powerful library that can generate testcases, run your program on those test cases and compare two program\textquotesingle{}s output for the given test case files and lists down the input that causes a different output to be produced. These features can come in handy when you are stuck on some corner cases for a problem or when want to check your program on random inputs but valid inputs. Test\+Caser has three submodules namely maker, integrator and comparator (only maker is ready for use as of now). Maker module is used to generate test cases. Integrator integreates a program to accept the test cases made by maker. Comparator compares two program\textquotesingle{}s outputs for given inputs.

Enough Let\textquotesingle{}s get you started with Test\+Caser.\hypertarget{index_sec_install}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_sec_install}
