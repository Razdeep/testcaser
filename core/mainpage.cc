 * \warning
 *  This is a preview version of testcaser.
 *  \section sec_intro Introduction
 * 
 *  TestCaser is a header-only light-weight test case maker library written in
 *  C++. It is easy, flexible and powerful library that can generate testcases,
 *  run your program on those test cases and compare two program's output for the
 *  given test case files and lists down the input that causes a different output to be produced.
 *  These features can come in handy when you are stuck on some corner cases for a problem or 
 *  when want to check your program on random inputs but valid inputs.
 *  TestCaser has three submodules namely maker, integrator and comparator (only maker is ready for use as of now).
 *  Maker module is used to generate test cases. Integrator integreates a program to accept the test cases made by maker.
 *  Comparator compares two program's outputs for given inputs.
 *
